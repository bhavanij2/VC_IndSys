CIDR Range - 10.183.0.0/16 okay? for VPC peering with shared non-prod and prod? unique routes?
And subnets /24 (256) okay??
CIDR Mask - /24 sufficient for all lambdas in private subnet

Can I reduce RDS CIDR to /25 (128)
And Public Subnet CIDR to /25 (128)
And rest shared IP range shared with Private?

Secondary Bastion - shutdown on start. How is it resumed when needed?

RDS Subnet - No NAT Gateway access

SG for Public Subnet? 
SG for Private Subnet?

Do we need other SG for Lambda/ECS application deployments in Private Subnet?

Tags included in each resource automatically.


VPC 10.183.0.0/20 -> Get IP Range inputs from Jesse for NonProd and Prod AWS account 
[ 4096 ]
RDS /24 [ 256 ]
Public /23 [512 ]
Private Subnet /24 (Biggest - All Remaining IPs)


Once peering is done, we need to update route tables and refer Peering ID into RdsSG

More define on defining Private Subnet SG to host Lambdas and ECS with Fargate - Check later
Mike Ortiz - ECS with Fargate
Lambdas - No SG needed.


Public Sudnet - API Gateway, ALB -> subnet CIDR range?
Lambda need any security group check ??
ECS with fargate security group??

Follow service catalog for RDS instances?


***

Can I edit VPC and Subnet CIDR later? - No
Ans: But can include more CIDR ranges for VPC, and can create more Subnets within the VPC

Can I keep spare CIDR in VPC to increase Public/Private IP range? - Yes
Can I increase the subnet CIDR or should we create a new Public/Private subnet in the VPC?
- Create New

API Gateway:
Has its own VPC, doesn't use our VPC ENIs

Elastic Load Balancer:
Used by ECS

Drift detection Lambda -> 

Cloud Trail logs - AWS Account API interactions

Cloud Watch Dashboards - Service Health like ECS, Lambda, ELB etc.

VPC - No monitoring is required. AWS handles it.
Security alerts are taken care by ISO/CloudOps and Account Owners would be notified about any potential breaches

APIs configured in API Gateway are returing some invalid HTTP response codes - If alerts needed, throttle, invalid requests --> Cloud Watch

Questions:

CF Drift Detection doesn't work?
Subnet -> RouteTable association changed
RouteTable updates
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift-resource-list.html

Cloud Trail:
Does not display all API activities? - After 15 mins

Is it configured only for 90 days or archived in S3 for future reference?
