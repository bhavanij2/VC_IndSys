Open Source Cloud Foundry
--------------------------


Questions:

Does Native CF have marketplace?
Is there any auto scaling facility available?
How is CF Monitoring configured?

Pros:

This option is already in use in Bayer. 
Cloud Engineering group in Bayer has expertize in this.
Integration of CF with CI/CD (Jenkins) is available
Enable approved deployments (alternative for velocity) and audit verification to be SOX complaint


Cons:

High setup and maintainance cost. Need specific team with expertize in setup and maintianance of CF instances

All our exisiting VC applications are tightly coupled to custom Cloud Foundry

Setup and maintain all Cloud Foundry components

Setup CF domains and routing components

Check an option for autoscaling of the components

Maintainance:
    Update / Patch:
        All cloud foundry components
        Build packs
        Existing Cloud Foundry Containers
        
Create and maintain/upgrade Build packs in various languages    

CF monitoring configuration

Have automatic backups of whole CF instance
        
Integrate with authentication system for SSO (Ping/Gigya/...)

*** Currently authorization to Org/Space is integrated with PAPI system. Need to find an option for that 

Setup and maintain CF service accounts. Provide periodic password expiry alerts for password rotation

Setup all the ISO security standards across CF

Define various Security Groups - CF component cluster SG, Staging SG, Runtime SG

Configure syslog drain

Setup any Admin Managed services

Enable approved deployments and audit verification to be SOX complaint

Backup CF routes through API gateway

Pivotal CF

Can we host as a service and connect to RDS instances?

PCF vs Kubernetes

PCF (PAAS)
- Suitable For more frequent releases for application code
- Any updates can be handled in one place - Buildpacks
- Spring tasks currently implemented are more compatible with PCF

Kubernetes (CAAS)
- Ideal to run Docker containers, 
- Suitable if you have lot of customization for your containers
- Need to maintain updates of runtime for the Docker images
- Need code changes for security patches or updates of runtime environment
- Need to convert all applications to Docker containers




*********

EKS expensive than Fargate
SSM Playbook


Fargate / ECS

Cloud Formation Templates to setup 



Don't use docker compose for Far / ECS

User Directory for backup



Splunk over Kibana

Cloud Watch for monitoring

Warf in front of AWS
