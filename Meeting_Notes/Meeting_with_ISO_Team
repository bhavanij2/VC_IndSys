Current framework 

Lot of requirements:
Cloud 9
Cloud security control readim
bashing
logging


Core controls to login to AWS account
Application architecture more room to look 


Is it separate Legal entity? 

who is responsible for security policies?

Keep all the existing security controls?

Slack, Email, Outlook, developer laptop security is gone?

Whole running cost of the new running system?

Find the hidden costs of hosting the independent system? (all ISO controls, administration)
